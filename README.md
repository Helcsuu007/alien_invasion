<b>Alien Invasion</b>

A simple, arcade-style game built with Python and the PyGame module (based on the code from the beginner Python programming book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes). I've added a game over screen so far (to the original code). I'm planning to expand and further develop/customize it in the coming months as I learn more about programming.

To start the game: <b>Run</b> <em>"alien_invasion.py"</em>.


<b>Controls</b>:

To move the ship: press <em>L/R arrow keys</em>.

To fire bullets: press <em>SPACE</em>.
